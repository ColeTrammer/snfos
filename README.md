# snfos

Simple Non-Functional Operating System

Created exploratorily to understand how Functional OS's work...

# To build
* preferable to install qemu and run ./qemu.sh to run the OS virtually.
* need to create the snfos version of gcc and binutils, a process detailed at OS Dev Wiki.

# Notes
* Needs to be be completely redesigned to accomodate symmetric multi processing and probably a bunch of other stuff.
* Unworkable build system that I have no idea how to improve.
* Horrible code organization and does not even support x86_64.
